#### Bird Monitoring team

<br>

![:scale 65%](02_pics/birdmon_team.png)

???

A majority of our work so far has involved engaging with Bird Count India, which is a collective of birders and bird monitors engaged in citizen science of birds across the country. Our team rarely ever *conducts* bird monitoring directly, but focuses on facilitating others to do so and to establish bigger, growing communities of interested people. Part of our vision is to empower this rapidly growing community to translate their data into meaningful, actionable insights.

As such, my role in the team lies more on the (eBird) data side of things: translating the data into outputs of potential use to the community, such as various data products (like reports, maps, graphs, etc.), tools (like an R package and replicable open-source, version-controlled, streamlined data workflows), and knowledge from more formal analyses (like research articles). 

So a day in the life for me would typically involve peering at screens full of data or code, or like many of us, manuscripts-in-progress. I know---not the most inspiring thing, and not what drew me to the field in the beginning! But these are interests I discovered later, and are important parts of doing science.

What is systematic monitoring? This is something very difficult to implement in a huge and diverse country like India.

By the way, SoIB 2023 analyses species not just at the nationwide level, but also at the level of individual states and habitats. This makes it possible to understand how differently a species is faring across states and habitats. For example, we can see here that peafowls have increased more rapidly in Karnataka than in the country overall.

This is also a good example that shows how the metric is an index of abundance, and not exact population estimates.

However, in some places the pool of data from birders is not sufficient to conduct these robust analyses. E.g., Bihar.

Indian Roller is a very familiar bird, but not doing very well. Aside from looking at how individual species are doing, we can investigate groups to understand broader patterns. For example, it is an open habitat specialist.

We see similar declines in other species of open habitats as well, that roughly match their degree of specialisation!

### Habitat specialisation

???

And when we zoom out to look at different habitat specialisations, here too we notice that the entire groups of open habitat or grassland/scrub specialists are also declining much more than specialists of other habitats. Wetland birds are another group that have declined considerably.
