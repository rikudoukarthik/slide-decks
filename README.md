# My Talks

This is a repository hosting all my slide decks for talks/presentations/workshops etc. The repository with its various folders is deployed to a Netlify site, making it possible to access the HTML slides at the URL `https://kartrix-doujutsu.netlify.app/folder-name`(i.e., talk name). Many of these talks are also featured in the *Talks* section of [my website](https://kartrick.rbind.io/), where talk details and links to the slides as well as the code used to make them are provided. 

Some of the folders are not entirely reproducible, as the original slides were made in a bigger project repository and only later copied into an individual repo (along with dependencies) for the purposes of hosting (such as the IOC talk, whose original repo is [here](https://github.com/rikudoukarthik/covid-ebirding)).
